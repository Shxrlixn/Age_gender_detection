# Person Detection, Age and Gender Estimation

This project uses OpenCV and pre-trained models to perform real-time person detection along with age and gender estimation using a webcam.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```

3. Download the necessary pre-trained models and place them in the `Person_Detection` directory:

   - [Haar Cascade for face detection](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)
   - [Age model files](https://github.com/age-gender-estimation/age-gender-estimation)
   - [Gender model files](https://github.com/age-gender-estimation/age-gender-estimation)

   Ensure the following files are present in the `Person_Detection` directory:

   - `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`
   - `deploy_age.prototxt`
   - `age_net.caffemodel`
   - `deploy_gender.prototxt`
   - `gender_net.caffemodel`

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. A window will open showing the webcam feed. Detected faces will be outlined with rectangles, and the estimated age and gender will be displayed above each face.

3. Press 'q' to exit the application.

## Customization

You can modify the parameters such as the detection scale factor or the minimum neighbors in the `detectMultiScale` method to optimize detection performance based on your requirements.
